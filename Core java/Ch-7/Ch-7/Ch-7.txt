list allows duplicate values

Set Interface
not ordered collection of elements

Set = no duplicate values, only unique

Deque Interface
pronounced as "deck"
full form of deque is "double ended queue"
supports both stack + queue
supports both LIFO + FIFO
LIFO = Last In First Out
FIFO = First In First Out

push() and pop() = LIFO

stores data in key-value pairs
if we pass same key, but with different values, it will overrite the value
