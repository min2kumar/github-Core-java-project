DAO Pattern
it is a design pattern

it separates your business logic with persistence logic
business logic = business methods
persistence logic = persistence methods
business logic to be kept in a POJO Class
and persistence logic to be kept separate in an interface

eg:
class = Employee
variable = id, name, salary, email, dept
object = e1,e2,e3, etc
methods:
business method = work on variables
getId(), getName(), setId(), setName(), changeName(), raiseSalary()
persistence method = work on objects
addEmployee(), updateEmployee(), removeEmployee(), findEmployeeById(), getAllEmployees()
